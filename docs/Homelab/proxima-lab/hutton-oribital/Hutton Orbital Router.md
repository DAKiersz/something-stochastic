# Hutton Orbital Router

## Synopsis

A ASUS RT-AC86X Router, running ASUS Merlin software, acting as the main networking device at home.

The name Hutton Orbital is a reference to a space station from a game named Elite Dangerous. This station orbits Proxima Centauri which Its notoriously mundane to get to from the hyperspace jump arrival point (Alpha Centauri A) which at 0.22ly takes 40 real-life minutes to traverse in in-game cruise mode. This distance makes it a very good name for a router that is on a 'edge' of the LAN. Ref: https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Hutton_Orbital
