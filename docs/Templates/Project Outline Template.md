# Project Outline Template

## Synopsis

As many people, I often struggle with setting objectives at work or research. There are known ways to mitigate the sense of being overwhelmed, such as the Eisenhower Matrix.

In my usual fashion, I've decided to write my own explanation for SMART OKR objectves.
OKR should follow SMART by default, but the description below is more explicit.

## Project Outline

* **Project** - The project name.
* **Goal** (or Objective) - A goal in this template should be a high level concept spanning tasks that are required to complete said project.
	* Essentially an **objective** in OKR, which **SMART** wholly comprises of.
* **Purpose** - Why is it important, what will it bring? 
	* Outside of SMART and OKR
* **Criteria** (or Key Results) - A set of **measurable** key results which are required to reach the goal. 
	* Essentially a a **key result** in OKR and analogous to a measurable(s) from SMART.
		* Include how many/much? How do you know if complete?
		* Alternatively, think of them as acceptance criteria in a ticket. What is the MVP for success?
	* A week or multiple to complete.
* **Task** - A single task part of the wider criteria. 
	* A day or few days to complete.
* **Sub-task** - An atomic element of the project, a singular step to complete within a task. 
	* At most a day to complete.

### Goal (or Objective in OKR) Requirements

Overall **goal** should **also** be **achievable**, realistic and **timely** (from SM**ART**):

* Achievable - Do we have the time and resources to achieve/attain the goal? Has it been successful before?
* Realistic - It is within reach, given above time and resources? Can I commit to it?
* Timely - By when do you finish this? Does it have a deadline?

### How can I ensure my OKRs are SMART?

* https://www.whatmatters.com/resources/okrs-smart-goals-difference-between

*To ensure your OKRs are SMART ones, ask yourself the following questions:*

1. Is my objective **Specific**?  
	* Narrow down on a central area improves the focus on your goals.
2. Are my key results **Measurable**? 
	* How will I quantify success?
